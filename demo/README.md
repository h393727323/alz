# Demo House Website

This is the official website for Demo House, an AI incubator.

## Structure

- `index.html`: The main landing page containing the website content.
- `style.css`: Contains the CSS styles, aiming for an Apple-like design aesthetic.
- `README.md`: This file.

## Development

To view the website, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

## Design Notes

The design aims for a clean, minimalist look inspired by Apple's web design:

- **Typography**: Uses the 'Inter' font, a common choice for modern UIs, with system fallbacks.
- **Color Palette**: Primarily uses white, light grays (`#f5f5f7`), dark text (`#1d1d1f`), secondary text (`#6e6e73`), and an accent blue (`#0071e3`).
- **Layout**: Uses flexbox and grid for layout, with generous whitespace and centered content sections.
- **Elements**: Features rounded corners on buttons and cards.

Further enhancements could include:

- Adding actual images and refining visual placeholders.
- Implementing interactive elements with JavaScript.
- Adding more detailed content to each section.
- Improving responsiveness for various screen sizes.
